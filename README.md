## Motivation

The primary motivation for this project was to prepare for an upcoming task involving Igor Sikorsky's office located at Sikorsky. The goal was to create a virtual tour similar to what would be required for the Sikorsky project, and to test the integration and formatting of a virtual tour on a website. This exercise not only helps in understanding the requirements and potential challenges but also serves to showcase my ability to handle such projects in a professional and efficient manner.

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to create a virtual tour of a classroom at Sacred Heart University using Matterport technology. The purpose is to provide an immersive, interactive experience that allows users to navigate through the classroom space as if they were physically present. This kind of virtual tour can be beneficial for prospective students, faculty members, and other stakeholders to get a feel of the campus facilities remotely.
